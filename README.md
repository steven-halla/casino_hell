HUGE HUGE HUGE
REFACTOR TIME!!!!

1) Lets fix the issues that kenny said:
2) Give more hint for first guy
3) fix key inputs, should be asdf for commands not T, hell maybe I can go for controller support?
4) Fix messages some of them are not displaying correct
5) treasure chest primary class needs revamped, it should contain all the methods for displaying/opening and such
6) The demon class is checked, all methods are handled here except drawing/updating
7) I need to redo classes for text boxes. 
8) There should be a primary class for text boxes perhaps, no idea why I have it as an entity?
9)  How many text boxes do I need? 
10) the screen class needs a full refactor as all screens need to look the same.
11)
