if you cant buy food for bar keep there is a strange flash error when it should be a simple "no". Also bar keep should't even let you talk to him if 
your food is less than 1.

If below 0 stamina there should be a global check in GambleScreen. 

Same for money loss, no need to check this for every screen in the game. 


bought something and text not aligned with item

fpr bar keep when i buy the carrion nachos level 1, the arrow is stuck at index 1 when i need to step it to 0
black jack its stuck on index of draw 
blcak jack when i quit it did not put me in gamble screen but rest screen
during black jack i got extra money, last hand was a black jack and it gave me the extra 100

boss needs to be looked at
