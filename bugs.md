if you cant buy food for bar keep there is a strange flash error when it should be a simple "no". Also bar keep should't even let you talk to him if 
your food is less than 1.

If below 0 stamina there should be a global check in GambleScreen. 

Same for money loss, no need to check this for every screen in the game.
